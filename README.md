# DTSA5301_NYPD_ShootingData
This is my GitHub repository for the DTSA 5301 Data Science as a Field through CU Boulder. I hope this work blesses and helps you!

Within this repository, there are four files of interest:

1. The raw R Markdown file
2. A knitted PDF of the R Markdown file
3. An elevator pitch overviewing the work
4. A longer presentation with slides
